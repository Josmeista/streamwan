This is a static website for Streamwan©

Streamwan© is a Green Internet Service Provider based in Kenya focused on reliable internet connectivity powered by renewable energy.They are committed to uptime, same day installation, exemplary customer service and after sale support.

This project is built on HTML and pure CSS.

Additional styling by Bootstrap for responsiveness.

The Q&A section was by far the most challenging part of this project.I had to implement Bootstrap Accordion for this section, which was a fairly new concept to me.

The pricing section was interesting to work on as I tried different card layout designs.

I appreciate Streamwan© for the oppoortunity to work on their webiste.

I also give credits to @philiac who was responsible for the design of the mockups.
